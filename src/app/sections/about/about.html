        <h2>Hey, I'm Rayyan</h2>
        <p> I’m a Computer Engineer and Full-Stack Developer who loves turning ideas into real, 
            functional products.<br> I’ve delivered multiple client projects, and I enjoy building clean, 
            fast, and intuitive user experiences. 
        </p>
        <p> I’m big on learning, experimenting, 
            and shipping. Frontend, backend, debugging something that broke <br>at 2 AM...
            I’m always up for the challenge.
        </p> 
        <p> Outside of tech, I’m a huge car enthusiast and a rap music fan which sums up my vibe pretty 
            well.
